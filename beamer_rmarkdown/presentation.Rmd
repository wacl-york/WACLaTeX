```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Motivation

<!-- Try experimenting with different themes in the preamble, metropolis is just a personal preference -->

What dataset did I use for that plot in that workshop presentation last year?
\end{quote}


  - \alert{Beamer} produces visually impressive presentations and its source files can easily be included in source control. However, even a basic presentation can require a lot of boiler plate code
  - \alert{RMarkdown} can be used to generate Beamer presentations allowing you to quickly write your slides in user-friendly RMarkdown with your plot-producing code adjacent
  - Create a new presentation in RStudio with `File` -> `New File` -> `R Markdown` -> `Presentation` -> `PDF (Beamer)`
  
## Basic formatting

  - New frames are indicated by lines starting with `##`
  - Sections are denoted by a single `#` 
  - All the usual markdown formatting options apply, such as:
    - Bullet points are denoted by `  -`
    - `*` for *italics*
    - `**` for **bold**
  - But you can also enter raw LaTeX:
    - `\alert{...}` \alert{highlights text} 
    - `$...$` for equations: $e = mc^2$
    
# Section One - output plots

## Slide with R Output

  - R code can be included in the usual RMarkdown fashion inside *```* chunks

```{r cars, echo = TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Exponential decay of x"}
x <- 1:10
y <- exp(-x)
qplot(x, y, geom="line") + theme_minimal()
```

## Slide with Python Output

  - You can even embed \alert{Python} code!

```{python pyex, echo = TRUE, fig.height=2.5, fig.cap="Exponential decay in Python"}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.arange(1, 10)
y = np.exp(-x)
plt.plot(x, y)
```

# Section Two - more useful features

## Two-column layout

::: columns

:::: {.column width=0.4}
  - You'll often want to display your plots alongside text in \alert{columns} using `:::` syntax
  - Plots can be resized using the chunk options `fig.height` and `fig.width`
  \footnotesize
  - Font size can be changed using standard LaTeX commands ([see here for a full list](https://latex-tutorial.com/changing-font-size/))
::::

:::: {.column width=0.6}
```{r colplot, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Plot in a column"}
qplot(x, y, geom = "line") + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size=20),
          axis.title = element_text(size=30))
```

## Tables

Data frames can be easily displayed as tables

```{r}
# Tip for better looking tables, add the `booktabs` LaTeX package and set booktabs=TRUE below
# To add LaTeX packages, see the documentation here
# https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-preamble.html
tibble(
    Gas = c("NO2", "O3", "CO2"),
    m1 = c(2, 8, 50),
    # Can't have duplicate column names so choose anything here and change later
    m2 = c(20, 30, 100),
    m3 = c(40, 52, 212),
    m4 = c(2, 8, 50) * 2,
    m5 = c(20, 30, 100) * 1.3,
    m6 = c(40, 52, 212) * 1.8
) %>%
    kable(
        "latex",
        booktabs = FALSE,
        col.names = c("Gas", rep(c("Min", "Mean", "Max"), 2)),
        align = c("l", rep("c", 6)),
        caption = "Results from a novel study"
    ) %>%
    kableExtra::add_header_above(c(
        " " = 1,
        "Manchester" = 3,
        "London" = 3
    ))
```

## Images

External images/figures can be included using the standard Markdown syntax
